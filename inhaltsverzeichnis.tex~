\begin{enumerate}
\item Preliminary Work
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Definition:  The pullback $m^\ast$ (Isomorphism between $K[G \times G]$ and $K[G] \otimes K[G]$)
  \item Definition:  Rational representation (with infinite-dimensional vector spaces)
  \item Definition:  Regular action
  \item An alternate definition for rational representation for finite vector spaces, and the proof for its equivalence
  \item Another equivalent definition for a rational representation which immediately follows from the last characterization
  \item Definition:  Invariants and the invariant ring
  \end{itemize}
\item Linearly reductive groups, the Reynolds operator and Hilbert's finiteness theorem
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Definition:  Reynolds operator
  \item Uniqueness of the Reynolds operator
  \item Definition:  linear reductiveness; definition via the Reynolds operator
  \item Remark about different ways to characterize linear reductiveness
  \item Definition:  A multiplication in $K[G]^\ast$
  \item Proposition:  The afore mentioned multiplication makes $K[G]^\ast$ into an associative algebra
  \item Definition:  The action of $K[G]^\ast$ on $V$ induced by an action of $G$ on $V$.
  \item A remark about how we can view the $K[G]^\ast$ action as an extension of the given one ($\sigma . v = \epsilon_\sigma \cdot v$ where $\epsilon_\sigma \in K[G]^\ast$ is the evaluation homomorphism).
  \item Remark:  $K[G]^\ast$ contains the Lie algebra as a subalgebra.
  \item Proposition:  A regular action of $G$ on an affine variety $X$ induces a rational representation $K[X]$ of $G$
  \item Proposition:  A Reynolds operator on $K[G]$ (action via left-multiplication) yields a Reynolds operator on $K[X]$ for any regular action of $G$ on $X$
