** Introduction
** Preliminary Work
*** Algebraic Geometry
- affine Varieties
- linear algebraic groups, example GL
- algebraic cohomomorphism, example multiplication
*** Invariant Theory
- regular action, example from prof, cross ratio maybe
- rational representation, example coordinate rings, conjugation
- invariants, example cross ratio
** Linearly Reductive Groups, The Reynolds Operator And Hilbert's Finiteness Theorem
*** The Reynolds Operator And Linearly Reductive Groups
- equivalences of "linearly reductive"
*** Hilbert's Finiteness Theorem
- theorem
- embeddings, example cross ratio
*** The Reynolds Operator Of A Linear Algebraic Group
- K[G]* as an associative K-algebra
- existence Reynolds operator of group implies linearly reductive
** Cayley's Omega Process
- everything
- examples from prof, conjugation and cross ratio
